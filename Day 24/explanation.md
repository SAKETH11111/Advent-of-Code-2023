# Day 24 Explanation

## Part 1

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the number of intersections between the paths of hailstones. Each hailstone has an initial position and velocity, and the paths are determined by these values.

### Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read the input file and parse the initial positions and velocities of the hailstones.
2. **Calculate Intersections**: For each pair of hailstones, calculate the intersection point of their paths.
3. **Check Validity**: Check if the intersection point is within the valid range and if the paths intersect at that point.
4. **Count Intersections**: Count the number of valid intersections.

### Code Explanation
- The code reads the input file and parses the initial positions and velocities of the hailstones.
- It calculates the intersection points for each pair of hailstones and checks their validity.
- The number of valid intersections is counted and printed.

## Part 2

### Problem Description
The task is to find the sum of the coordinates of the intersection point where the paths of the hailstones intersect. The intersection point is determined by solving a system of equations.

### Approach
1. **Parse Input**: Parse the input to extract the initial positions and velocities of the hailstones.
2. **Set Up Equations**: Set up a system of equations based on the positions and velocities of the hailstones.
3. **Solve Equations**: Solve the system of equations to find the intersection point.
4. **Calculate Sum**: Calculate the sum of the coordinates of the intersection point.

### Code Explanation
- The code parses the input to extract the initial positions and velocities of the hailstones.
- It sets up a system of equations based on the positions and velocities.
- The system of equations is solved to find the intersection point.
- The sum of the coordinates of the intersection point is calculated and printed.
