# Day 07 Explanation

## Part 1

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the strength of a hand in a card game. The hand consists of characters representing cards, and the goal is to calculate the strength based on specific rules.

### Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read the input file, strip extra whitespaces, and split it into lines.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Initialize variables to store the strength of each hand.
3. **Process Each Line**: Iterate through each line in the input.
   - **Replace Characters**: Replace specific characters in the hand to standardize the representation.
   - **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of each character in the hand.
   - **Determine Strength**: Determine the strength of the hand based on the counts of characters.
4. **Print Results**: Print the results for each hand.

### Code Explanation
- The code reads the input file and processes each line to determine the strength of each hand.
- It replaces specific characters to standardize the representation of the hand.
- The strength of the hand is determined based on the counts of characters.
- The results are printed for each hand.

## Part 2

### Problem Description
In addition to the standard rules, the task is to handle a special case where the character '1' can be combined with other characters to form a stronger hand.

### Approach
1. **Handle Special Case**: For each hand, check if the character '1' can be combined with other characters to form a stronger hand.
2. **Update Counts**: Update the counts of characters based on the combination.
3. **Determine Strength**: Determine the strength of the hand based on the updated counts.

### Code Explanation
- The code includes additional logic to handle the special case where the character '1' can be combined with other characters.
- It updates the counts of characters based on the combination and determines the strength of the hand.
- The results are printed for each hand.
