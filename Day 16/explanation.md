# Day 16 Explanation

## Part 1

### Problem Description
The task is to navigate a grid with specific rules for movement. The grid contains various characters that dictate the direction of movement. The goal is to determine the number of unique positions visited starting from the top-left corner and moving according to the rules.

### Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read the input file and split it into lines to create a grid.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Initialize variables for the number of rows, columns, and directions for movement.
3. **Define Movement Function**: Create a function to determine the next position based on the current position and direction.
4. **Track Positions**: Use a set to track unique positions visited during the movement.
5. **Simulate Movement**: Simulate the movement starting from the top-left corner and update the set of visited positions.
6. **Calculate Result**: Calculate the number of unique positions visited and print the result.

### Code Explanation
- The code reads the input file and creates a grid of characters.
- It initializes variables for the number of rows, columns, and directions for movement.
- A function is defined to determine the next position based on the current position and direction.
- A set is used to track unique positions visited during the movement.
- The movement is simulated starting from the top-left corner, and the set of visited positions is updated.
- The number of unique positions visited is calculated and printed.

## Part 2

### Problem Description
In addition to the unique positions visited, the task is to find the maximum number of unique positions visited starting from any edge of the grid.

### Approach
1. **Track Maximum Positions**: Initialize a variable to track the maximum number of unique positions visited.
2. **Simulate Movement from Edges**: Simulate the movement starting from each edge of the grid and update the maximum number of unique positions visited.
3. **Calculate Result**: Calculate the maximum number of unique positions visited and print the result.

### Code Explanation
- The code includes additional logic to track the maximum number of unique positions visited.
- It simulates the movement starting from each edge of the grid and updates the maximum number of unique positions visited.
- The maximum number of unique positions visited is calculated and printed.
