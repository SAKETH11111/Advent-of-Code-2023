# Day 09 Explanation

## Part 1

### Problem Description
The task is to extrapolate the next value in a sequence based on the given differences. The input file contains lines with sequences of integers. The goal is to calculate the sum of extrapolated values for each line in the input file.

### Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read the input file and split it into lines.
2. **Extrapolate Next Value**: For each line, convert the sequence of integers and calculate the next value using the given differences.
3. **Sum Extrapolated Values**: Calculate the sum of extrapolated values for each line.
4. **Print Result**: Print the result of the sum of extrapolated values.

### Code Explanation
- The code reads the input file and processes each line to convert the sequence of integers.
- It calculates the next value in the sequence based on the given differences.
- The sum of extrapolated values is calculated and printed.

## Part 2

### Problem Description
In addition to extrapolating the next value in a sequence, the task is to calculate the sum of extrapolated values in reverse order for each line in the input file.

### Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read the input file and split it into lines.
2. **Extrapolate Next Value in Reverse Order**: For each line, convert the sequence of integers and calculate the next value in reverse order using the given differences.
3. **Sum Extrapolated Values**: Calculate the sum of extrapolated values in reverse order for each line.
4. **Print Result**: Print the result of the sum of extrapolated values in reverse order.

### Code Explanation
- The code reads the input file and processes each line to convert the sequence of integers.
- It calculates the next value in the sequence in reverse order based on the given differences.
- The sum of extrapolated values in reverse order is calculated and printed.
