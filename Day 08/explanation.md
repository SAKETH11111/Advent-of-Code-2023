# Day 08 Explanation

## Part 1

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the final state of a set of positions based on a series of steps and rules. The input consists of a series of steps and a set of rules that dictate how the positions change.

### Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read the input file, strip extra whitespaces, and split it into lines.
2. **Parse Steps and Rules**: Split the input into steps and rules sections.
3. **Initialize Positions**: Initialize the positions based on the rules.
4. **Process Each Step**: Iterate through each step and update the positions based on the rules.
5. **Determine Final State**: Determine the final state of the positions after processing all steps.

### Code Explanation
- The code reads the input file and splits it into steps and rules sections.
- It initializes the positions based on the rules and processes each step to update the positions.
- The final state of the positions is determined and returned.

## Part 2

### Problem Description
In addition to the standard rules, the task is to handle a special case where certain positions have different rules for updating.

### Approach
1. **Handle Special Case**: For each position, check if it has a special rule and update accordingly.
2. **Update Positions**: Update the positions based on the special rules.
3. **Determine Final State**: Determine the final state of the positions after processing all steps and special rules.

### Code Explanation
- The code includes additional logic to handle the special case where certain positions have different rules.
- It updates the positions based on the special rules and determines the final state.
- The results are printed for both parts.
