# Day 20 Explanation

## Problem Description
The task is to process a set of rules and signals to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of certain time intervals. The rules define how signals propagate and interact with each other.

## Approach
1. **Read Input File**: Read the input file and split it into lines.
2. **Parse Rules**: Parse the rules to extract the source and destination signals.
3. **Adjust Signal Types**: Adjust the types of signals based on predefined types.
4. **Create Dependency Graph**: Create dictionaries to store dependencies and inverse dependencies between signals.
5. **Initialize Counters and Queues**: Initialize counters and queues to process the signals.
6. **Iterate Through Timestamps**: Iterate through timestamps to process the signals and calculate the LCM.

## Code Explanation
- The code reads the input file and splits it into lines.
- It parses the rules to extract the source and destination signals.
- It adjusts the types of signals based on predefined types.
- It creates dictionaries to store dependencies and inverse dependencies between signals.
- It initializes counters and queues to process the signals.
- It iterates through timestamps to process the signals and calculate the LCM.
- The result is printed.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Read Input File**: The input file is read and split into lines.
2. **Parse Rules**: The rules are parsed to extract the source and destination signals. The rules are stored in a dictionary.
3. **Adjust Signal Types**: The types of signals are adjusted based on predefined types. This is done using a function that adds a prefix to the signal type.
4. **Create Dependency Graph**: Dictionaries are created to store dependencies and inverse dependencies between signals. The dependencies are stored in a dictionary where the key is the signal and the value is a list of dependent signals.
5. **Initialize Counters and Queues**: Counters and queues are initialized to process the signals. The counters keep track of the number of times a signal is processed, and the queues store the signals to be processed.
6. **Iterate Through Timestamps**: The signals are processed by iterating through timestamps. The signals are processed based on the rules and dependencies. The LCM is calculated using the timestamps when all signals in the watch list have been processed.

### Example
Consider the following example:
```
input.txt:
broadcaster -> button
button -> &rx
&rx -> rx
rx -> A
```
The code will process the signals based on the rules and calculate the LCM of the time intervals when all signals in the watch list have been processed.

## Conclusion
The code processes a set of rules and signals to determine the LCM of certain time intervals. The approach involves reading the input file, parsing the rules, adjusting signal types, creating a dependency graph, initializing counters and queues, and iterating through timestamps to process the signals and calculate the LCM.
